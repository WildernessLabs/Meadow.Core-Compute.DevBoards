## Hardware Design Files

Schematics, BoM, and fabrication files can be found below.

 * [Dev Breakout w/Dual Ethernet](Source/Hardware/Dev_Breakout_w_Dual-Ethernet/v2.a/)
 * [Dev Breakout w/out Ethernet](Source/Hardware/Dev_Breakout_no_Ethernet/v2.a/)

 Note that these boards are built largely with our [Hardware Addon Modules](https://github.com/WildernessLabs/Hardware_Addon_Modules), which simplify prototyping with the Meadow Core-Compute module.
